# Question Bank for Achievement Extraction

Use these questions when the user gives vague or brief answers. Pick the most relevant
questions for each role rather than asking all of them.

## Context Excavation

- What did you actually build/fix/improve on a daily basis?
- If you disappeared for a month, what would break first?
- What did senior engineers or leadership come to you for specifically?
- What was on fire when you arrived? What was stable when you left?
- What decisions did you make that nobody else was willing or able to make?
- What was the state of the codebase/system/team before vs. after your tenure?

## Scale Revelation

### User Impact

- How many people used what you built? (customers, internal users, anyone)
- What happened when your system went down? Who was affected and how urgently?
- How many times per day/second did your code execute?
- How many concurrent users did your system support at peak?

### Velocity

- What took 4 hours before that now takes 4 minutes because of you?
- What manual process did you automate? How many person-hours per week did it save?
- What deployment/test/build process did you accelerate? From what duration to what?
- How did you change the team's shipping cadence? (weekly to daily? monthly to weekly?)

### Reliability

- What broke weekly that now never breaks?
- What uptime did you achieve? (99.9%? 99.99%?)
- How many on-call incidents or 3am emergencies did you prevent?
- What monitoring/alerting did you put in place?

### Money Tracker

- How much revenue flowed through your code or systems?
- What costs did you eliminate? (servers, tools, manual labor, vendor contracts)
- What would it cost the business if your system was down for an hour?
- What was the ROI of the project/feature you delivered?
- What budget were you responsible for?

## Innovation Timeline

- What did you build or adopt before it was standard practice?
- What technical bet did you make that paid off?
- What approaches failed before yours worked?
- What did you try that shouldn't have worked but did?
- Who said it couldn't be done?

## Complexity Showcase

- What was the hardest technical problem you solved in this role?
- What made it hard? (Scale? Constraints? Legacy systems? Time pressure?)
- What trade-offs did you navigate?
- What did you have to learn from scratch to solve it?

## Influence Amplifier

- What did you teach or document that changed how the team works?
- What tools, frameworks, or practices did you introduce that others adopted?
- Which team members credit you with their growth or promotion?
- What architectural decisions or patterns of yours are still in place?
- What hiring, onboarding, or culture improvements did you drive?
- What cross-team collaboration did you initiate or lead?

## Estimation Helpers

When the user doesn't know exact numbers, help them estimate:

- **User count**: "How many people were in the company? What percentage used your tool?"
- **Time savings**: "How long did the old process take? How long now? How often per week?"
- **Revenue**: "What was the company's annual revenue? What percentage touched your system?"
- **Cost savings**: "How many people did the manual version? What's their approximate salary?"
  - Quick formula: X people _ Y hours/week _ $50/hour \* 52 weeks = annual savings
- **Scale**: "How many rows in the database? How many API calls per day show in logs?"
