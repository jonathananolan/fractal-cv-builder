---

## Transformation Plan: 8 Steps

### Step 1: Craft the Executive Summary

**Objective:** Create a 3-line narrative that positions you as the rare leader who combines clinical insight, policy influence, product execution, and technical depth.

**Target output:**

- Health domain credibility (clinical background + policy impact)
- Executive scope (briefed Premier/Cabinet, managed 20-person team)
- Product/commercial wins (Feather revenue, user growth)
- Technical differentiation (AI/ML, data platforms)

**Metrics to highlight:**

- Impact on millions (Victoria COVID policy)
- Team scale (20-person analytics unit)
- Revenue/growth (Feather $500k raised, 1,700 users)
- Technical scale (200TB data pipelines, agent-based models)

---

### Step 2: Reposition Victorian Health Roles

**Objective:** Elevate Director roles from "government policy" to "executive leadership at enterprise scale during crisis"

**Key transformations:**

- "Director – Modelling & Analytics" → Position as CTO/VP Analytics equivalent
  - Built 20-person data org from zero
  - Created decision platforms used by state leadership
  - Delivered tools with life-or-death impact (equivalent to healthcare SaaS reliability stakes)
  - Published research, briefed C-suite (Premier = CEO)

**Bullets to add:**

- Specific technology stack: R, SQL, Shiny, automated pipelines
- Throughput metrics: How many analyses per week? Dashboard users?
- Decision velocity: Time from model run to Cabinet presentation
- Cross-functional leadership: Policy + clinical + engineering teams

**Questions for next step:**

- How many analyses/models delivered weekly?
- How many users accessed your dashboards?
- What was the time from data ingestion to policy recommendation?
- How did your monitoring framework compare to commercial health-tech tools?

---

### Step 3: Transform Feather Experience

**Objective:** Position Feather as a VP Product/CTO proving ground, not just a startup role

**Current strengths:**

- 0→1,700 paying users
- Product strategy ownership
- 30% of codebase contribution
- GTM leadership (World's Biggest Jam)

**Enhancements needed:**

- Revenue numbers: What was MRR/ARR at peak?
- Retention metrics: 40% re-attendance → reframe as cohort retention
- Engineering leadership: How many engineers managed?
- Technical decisions: Infrastructure choices, tech stack ownership
- Commercial impact: Customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, churn rate

**Target narrative:**
"Head of Product/Technical Co-Founder at B2B SaaS serving fitness studios. Built product from zero to 1,700 paying users and $XXk ARR. Led 0→1 product strategy, authored 30% of codebase (React/Node.js), managed X engineers, shipped XX features in YY months. Implemented data platform (GCP/BigQuery) enabling analytics-driven growth. Rejection of premature mobile app saved 4+ months runway."

**Questions for next step:**

- Peak MRR or ARR?
- Customer acquisition metrics?
- Revenue per customer?
- What was the team size you led?
- Infrastructure costs and optimization?

---

### Step 4: Reframe PassBox as Health-Tech Adjacent

**Objective:** Position as "founder-level experience building hardware-data product for public health impact"

**Key repositioning:**

- This is a health intervention (road safety = injury prevention)
- Hardware + software + data product (full-stack founding experience)
- Government B2B sales (Victoria TAC, Dept of Transport)
- Evidence-based policy influence (1-metre laws adopted)

**Bullets to emphasize:**

- 200TB data pipeline (scale credential)
- Computer vision + OpenCV (technical depth)
- Multi-state operations (enterprise deployment complexity)
- Policy wins (quantify lives saved via injury reduction estimates)

**Add:**

- Team size managed across engineering/field ops
- Contract values from government clients
- Cost per unit of hardware device
- Public health impact: Estimated injuries prevented via infrastructure changes

**Questions for next step:**

- What were the contract values from TAC/Dept of Transport?
- How many team members did you manage?
- Cost and margin on hardware units?
- Can we estimate injuries prevented from infrastructure changes?

---

### Step 6: Build the Technical Arsenal Section

**Objective:** Demonstrate VP-level technical credibility across health data, AI/ML, and product engineering

**Structure:**

**HEALTH DOMAIN EXPERTISE:**

- Epidemiological modeling (SEIR, agent-based models for 5M population)
- Clinical medicine (ICU, Emergency, procedural skills)
- Healthcare economics (cost-effectiveness analysis, value-based care)
- Public health policy (COVID elimination strategy, road safety interventions)

**AI/ML & DATA PLATFORMS:**

- LLM orchestration: Agentic workflows, RAG architecture, vector databases
- Data engineering: R, Python, SQL pipelines processing 200TB+
- Analytics: Shiny dashboards, real-time monitoring, decision-support tools
- Computer vision: OpenCV for video analysis at scale

**PRODUCT & ENGINEERING:**

- Full-stack: React, Node.js, TypeScript (30% of production codebase)
- Infrastructure: GCP (Cloud Run, BigQuery, Cloud SQL), AWS
- Data platforms: Stripe Connect, Amplitude, automated ETL pipelines
- Testing: Playwright E2E suites, regression prevention

**LEADERSHIP SCALE:**

- Largest team: 20-person analytics unit
- Stakeholder level: Briefed Premier, Cabinet, Ministers
- User base: 1,700 paying B2B customers; 5M population impact (Victoria)
- Data processed: 200TB+ across video, epidemiological, health records

### Step 7: Craft the "Why Health-Tech" Narrative

**Objective:** Create a coherent story connecting clinical → policy → product → commercial health-tech

**Draft narrative:**
"I've approached healthcare transformation from three angles: as a clinician treating patients, as a policy leader shaping statewide health strategy during COVID, and as a product builder creating tools for health/wellness businesses. Each role revealed the same truth: healthcare's biggest opportunities lie at the intersection of domain expertise, data infrastructure, and product execution.

At Victorian Health, I built the analytics platform that guided a state through a pandemic—decision tools with life-or-death stakes and enterprise-scale reliability requirements. At Feather, I translated that systems thinking into B2B SaaS, taking a product from zero to 1,700 paying users while contributing 30% of the codebase. With PassBox, I proved I could build hardware-data products that influence public health policy.

Now I'm focused on health-tech because the sector needs leaders who understand clinical workflows, can architect data platforms, and know how to ship products that work in regulated environments. The AI opportunity in healthcare is massive, but execution requires people who've actually worked in the system."

**Positioning themes:**

1. Rare combination: Clinical + policy + product + technical
2. Proven at scale: Enterprise scope, executive stakeholders
3. Commercial execution: Revenue, users, fundraising
4. Health-specific: Not a generic tech leader pivoting to healthcare

---

### Step 8: Create Role-Specific Versions

**Objective:** Tailor CV for different health-tech archetypes

**Version A: Clinical AI/ML Company (e.g., Heidi, Abridge, Commure)**

- Lead with: Clinical AI project, Victorian Health analytics platform, clinical background
- Emphasize: LLM/RAG architecture, healthcare data pipelines, clinical workflow knowledge
- De-emphasize: PassBox hardware, non-health policy work

**Version B: Health Data/Analytics Platform (e.g., Arcadia, Health Catalyst)**

- Lead with: Victorian Health 20-person analytics team, decision-support platforms
- Emphasize: Data engineering at scale, stakeholder management, healthcare economics
- De-emphasize: Clinical practice, front-end engineering

**Version C: Digital Health B2B SaaS (e.g., Headway, Tia, Zocdoc)**

- Lead with: Feather product leadership, 0→1,700 users, B2B SaaS experience
- Emphasize: Product execution, GTM, stakeholder management, commercial growth
- De-emphasize: Epidemiological modeling, clinical procedures

**Version D: General Health-Tech Leadership**

- Balanced approach across all experiences
- Executive summary emphasizes breadth: clinical + policy + product + technical

## Next Steps: Execution Plan

We'll work through these 8 steps sequentially. For each step, I'll:

1. Ask clarifying questions about metrics/context
2. Draft the content together
3. Refine based on your feedback
4. Move to the next step

After completing all steps, we'll have:

- ✅ Polished executive summary
- ✅ Rewritten role descriptions with health-tech framing
- ✅ Technical arsenal section
- ✅ Clear narrative arc
- ✅ 4 tailored versions for different health-tech segments

**Timeline estimate:** 60–90 minutes of focused work across these sessions.
